# Exercise 1: SDLC Models and Testing Strategy

## Purpose

These exercises help you understand how different SDLC models affect testing strategy. The goal is to develop **intuition** for adapting your testing approach based on the development model.

## Exercise 1.1: Waterfall Model Testing

### Task

Imagine a project using Waterfall model:

**Phases**:
1. Requirements (2 weeks)
2. Design (3 weeks)
3. Implementation (8 weeks)
4. Testing (4 weeks)
5. Deployment (1 week)

1. **Plan Testing**:
   - When would you start test planning?
   - What would you do in each phase?
   - How would you prepare for testing phase?

2. **Testing Phase Activities**:
   - What would you test?
   - How would you organize testing?
   - What challenges would you face?

3. **Reflect on Waterfall**:
   - What are the advantages for testing?
   - What are the disadvantages?
   - How would you mitigate challenges?

### Reflection

- How does late testing affect defect discovery?
- What can you do in earlier phases to help testing?
- How do you ensure quality in Waterfall?

## Exercise 1.2: V-Model Testing

### Task

Map testing to V-Model phases:

**Left Side (Development)**:
- Requirements
- System Design
- Detailed Design
- Implementation

**Right Side (Testing)**:
- Acceptance Testing
- System Testing
- Integration Testing
- Unit Testing

1. **Map Testing Activities**:
   - What testing happens at each level?
   - How does it correspond to development?
   - What test documents are created when?

2. **Create Test Plan**:
   - Plan tests for each level
   - Show how they trace to requirements
   - Document entry/exit criteria

3. **Reflect on V-Model**:
   - How does parallel planning help?
   - What's the value of traceability?
   - What are the limitations?

### Reflection

- How does V-Model improve on Waterfall?
- Why is traceability important?
- How does this model help with verification?

## Exercise 1.3: Agile Model Testing

### Task

Imagine an Agile project with 2-week sprints:

**Sprint Structure**:
- Sprint Planning (Day 1)
- Development (Days 2-8)
- Testing (Days 9-10)
- Sprint Review (Day 10)
- Retrospective (Day 10)

1. **Plan Testing for Sprint**:
   - When do you test?
   - How do you test continuously?
   - What's your daily testing routine?

2. **Test Activities**:
   - What do you do during development?
   - What do you do during testing days?
   - How do you handle incomplete features?

3. **Continuous Testing**:
   - How do you test as features are built?
   - How do you test integration?
   - How do you handle changes?

### Reflection

- How is Agile testing different from Waterfall?
- What's the value of continuous testing?
- How do you maintain quality in fast iterations?
- What challenges does Agile present for testing?

## Exercise 1.4: Comparing Models

### Task

Create a comparison table:

| Aspect | Waterfall | V-Model | Agile |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Testing Timing | ? | ? | ? |
| Test Planning | ? | ? | ? |
| Change Handling | ? | ? | ? |
| Documentation | ? | ? | ? |
| Feedback Speed | ? | ? | ? |
| Best For | ? | ? | ? |

Fill in each cell and justify your answers.

### Reflection

- What patterns do you see?
- Which model is best for testing? (Hint: depends on context)
- How do you choose a model?
- Can you mix approaches?

---

## Exercise 1.5: Adapting Testing Strategy

### Task

You're a QA Engineer. The project changes models:

**Scenario A**: Waterfall → Agile
- How does your testing strategy change?
- What new activities do you do?
- What do you stop doing?
- What challenges do you face?

**Scenario B**: Agile → Waterfall
- How does your testing strategy change?
- What new activities do you do?
- What do you stop doing?
- What challenges do you face?

### Reflection

- How adaptable is your testing approach?
- What skills transfer across models?
- How do you learn new models?
- What's universal vs. model-specific?

---

## Exercise 1.6: Real-World Application

### Task

Think about a project you know (or imagine one):

1. **Identify the Model**:
   - What SDLC model is used?
   - Is it pure or hybrid?
   - How do you know?

2. **Current Testing Strategy**:
   - How is testing organized?
   - When does testing happen?
   - What works well?
   - What doesn't?

3. **Improvement**:
   - How could testing be improved?
   - What would you change?
   - What constraints prevent change?

### Reflection

- How does understanding SDLC models help you?
- How can you improve testing in your current model?
- What would you change if you could?

---

## Exercise 1.7: Hybrid Approaches

### Task

Many projects use hybrid approaches:

**Example**: Agile development with Waterfall-like releases

1. **Identify Hybrid Elements**:
   - What's Agile about it?
   - What's Waterfall about it?
   - How do they combine?

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - How do you test in Agile sprints?
   - How do you test for releases?
   - What's the balance?

3. **Challenges**:
   - What conflicts arise?
   - How do you resolve them?
   - What works well?

### Reflection

- Are hybrid approaches common?
- How do you adapt testing to hybrids?
- What's the best of both worlds?

## 🎯 Self-Assessment

After completing these exercises, ask yourself:

1. Can I explain how each SDLC model affects testing?
2. Do I know when to use which model?
3. Can I adapt my testing strategy to different models?
4. Do I understand the trade-offs?
5. Can I work effectively in different models?

## 💡 Key Insights to Carry Forward

- **SDLC models determine testing strategy** - Different models, different approaches
- **Waterfall tests late** - Sequential, formal, challenges with late defect discovery
- **V-Model tests parallel** - Verification at each level, better traceability
- **Agile tests continuously** - Integrated, adaptive, fast feedback
- **Context matters** - Choose model (and testing approach) based on project
- **Hybrids are common** - Adapt testing to the actual process
- **Flexibility is key** - Be able to work in different models
